# Example tbdex remittance for USD to AUD

This is an example remittance PFI implementation using the tbdex protocol which uses a real payment API.

This example will: 

* Show a single HTML page plain javascript client page that captures a credit card, creates a DID and requests a Verifiable Credential.
* A server which does an "OFAC" check on the customer and issues a verifiable credential only if they are not on the OFAC list.
* A tbdex protocol implementation that will charge the customer's credit card in USD and remit AUD as required to specified bank account.

See `src/didpay-client/index.html` for the client code and `src/main.ts` for the liquidity node code (server).

NOTE: this is not using market rates, or anything sensible, and is for illustrative purposes only, not production use.

# Development Prerequisites

## `node` and `npm`
This project is using `node v20.3.1` and `npm >=v7.0.0`. You can verify your `node` and `npm` installation via the terminal:

```
$ node --version
v20.3.1
$ npm --version
9.6.7
```

If you don't have `node` installed, feel free to choose whichever installation approach you feel the most comfortable with. If you don't have a preferred installation method, we recommend using `nvm` (aka node version manager). `nvm` allows you to install and use different versions of node. It can be installed by running `brew install nvm` (assuming that you have homebrew)

Once you have installed `nvm`, install the desired node version with `nvm install vX.Y.Z`.

## Docker
Docker is used to spin up a local mysql container. Docker for Mac can be installed from [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)

## `dbmate`
dbmate is used to run database migrations. Run `brew install dbmate` from your command line

# Preparing setup (one time)

> ðŸ’¡ Make sure you have all the [prerequisites](#development-prerequisites)

1) run `cp .env.example .env`. This is where you can set any necessary environment variables. `.env.example` contains all environment variables that you _can_ set.
2) Go to https://pinpayments.com/ and sign up to an account, then get a test api secret key, set it to `SEC_PIN_PAYMENTS_SECRET_KEY` either in .env or your local environment.
3) Put the secret key in .env

`npm run server` to check it runs. 

# Running end to end remittance flow

## Step 1: Run liquidity node  

Run the server (or restart it) in another terminal window: 

`npm run server`

## Step 2: Open `src/didpay-client/index.html` in a browser

Each interaction happens in the context of an "Exchange" which is a record of the interaction between the customer and the PFI.

# Implementing a PFI

The business logic for the PFI is mainly in [main.ts](src/main.ts) and the offerings as specified in [offerings.ts](src/offerings.ts). Poke around!
